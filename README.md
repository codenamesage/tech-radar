# Tech Radar

Check the Tech Radar at: [https://codenamesage.github.io/tech-radar/](https://codenamesage.github.io/tech-radar/)

## Setting Up Data

Please update the file [`data.json`](src/data/data.json) with the relevant technologies.

## Quadrants

- **Techniques**
- **Platforms**
- **Tools**
- **Languages & Frameworks**

Each insight we share is represented by a blip. Blips may be new to the latest radar version or may have moved rings as our recommendation has changed.

## Rings

- **Adopt** – Technologies we strongly recommend you use.
- **Trial** – Ready for use but not as proven as those in the Adopt ring.
- **Assess** – Worth exploring, but not necessarily for immediate use unless there's a strong case.
- **Hold** – Use with caution or avoid for now.

## Showing Blip Movement

If you want to show movement of blips between radar versions, add an optional `status` column to your dataset.

Accepted values (case-insensitive):

- `New` – Appearing on the radar for the first time
- `Moved In` – Moving closer to the center
- `Moved Out` – Moving further from the center
- `No Change` – No change in position
